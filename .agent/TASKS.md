# Active Tasks

Only active approved executable implementation/closure work belongs here. Detailed completed execution/audit lineage belongs in `.artifacts/**`.

## Current active capability

**Value & Result Type Expansion** remains the active approved SwiftDuckDB capability. The Wave B non-Decimal exact driver vertical is complete and accepted through B5 plus fresh R3 root audit. **P03 Foundation.Decimal exactness probing is coordinator-accepted PASS after fresh final root audit CLEAN; Wave C Decimal production planning is now the active next separately reviewed step.**

Prerequisites are complete and accepted:

```text
SwifQL 2.0.0-beta.6.0.1 published + consumed
A2 logical metadata milestone accepted + root audit CLEAN
P01 temporal/raw adapter probe accepted
P02 Foundation.Date/TIMESTAMPTZ exactness probe accepted
```

B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5 are accepted. Fresh R3 whole non-Decimal root audit is accepted CLEAN with zero blockers. The accepted current package baseline is `242/0` under Swift 6.3.3 warnings-as-errors, with protected `18/18` regressions, fresh build PASS, and preserved normal-import marker `B5-CONSUMER-OK`.

## Active sequencing

```text
B1 — ACCEPTED: Int128 / UInt128 / UUID exact vertical
B2 — ACCEPTED: PureDate / PureTime / DateTime exact vertical
B3 — ACCEPTED: TIMESTAMPTZ / Foundation.Date exact vertical
B4 — ACCEPTED: SwifQL.Interval / DuckDB INTERVAL exact vertical
B5 — ACCEPTED: concurrency/regression/external-consumer hardening
R3 — CLEAN / ACCEPTED: fresh independent Non-Decimal Value Vertical Root Audit
P03 — PASS / ACCEPTED: Foundation.Decimal exactness probe + final fresh root audit CLEAN
Wave C — ACTIVE PLANNING: exact Decimal production integration; source mutation remains locked until plan audit + coordinator acceptance
```

Each implementation/probe slice requires its own frozen prompt, validation, coordinator review, and local checkpoint before the next slice is promoted. P03 acceptance authorizes Wave C planning only, not Decimal production source mutation. Wave C must carry the accepted DCT128-v1 algorithm materially unchanged; a materially different Decimal conversion algorithm requires a new P03 lineage instead of silently narrowing, rounding, or substituting a different representation.

## Universal Wave B path contract

Every implemented type family must use the existing architecture and cover:

```text
ordinary query binding/execution
reusable Statement binding/reuse
Appender complete-row ingestion
result materialization
NULL / Optional
logical result metadata
boundary values and exact rejection
```

Resolved native target metadata must be honored exactly. Targetless values use only the deterministic natural target frozen by the accepted plan/corrections.

Rounding, lossy narrowing, sentinel collision, unsupported special states, and unchecked overflow are forbidden. Reject before unsafe native mutation whenever the existing architecture permits preflight.

## Frozen conversion anchors

P01 is authoritative for DATE/TIME/TIME_NS/TIMESTAMP S/MS/us/NS finite ranges, infinity sentinels, divisibility, exact 24:00 handling, checked overflow, and floor-consistent negative/pre-epoch conversion.

Important natural-target rules:

```text
targetless PureTime -> TIME_NS
targetless DateTime -> TIMESTAMP_NS only when exactly representable
```

P02 is authoritative for TIMESTAMPTZ/Foundation.Date:

```text
native identity: signed Int64 microseconds since Unix epoch
DuckDB ±Int64.max sentinels: reject for Foundation.Date
non-finite Foundation.Date: reject
conversion: Foundation-reference split algorithm
acceptance: exact bidirectional per-value equality only
silent rounding/tolerance: forbidden
```

Largest contiguous guaranteed exact subset:

```text
[-7_611_627_392_000_000, 9_568_241_792_000_000] microseconds
```

That subset is not a hard bound; sparse exact values outside it remain valid when the accepted per-value predicate succeeds.

## Current public compatibility boundary

After accepted Wave B, public `Value` supports:

```text
null
Bool
Int8 / Int16 / Int32 / Int64
UInt8 / UInt16 / UInt32 / UInt64
Float / Double
String
Data
UUID
Int128 / UInt128 through availability-gated bridges on macOS 15+ / iOS 18+
PureDate
PureTime
DateTime
Foundation.Date as exact TIMESTAMPTZ
SwifQL.Interval
```

`Value` is a public struct facade with internal exhaustive storage. Exact 128-bit values are stored as hidden word pairs so the package remains buildable at the macOS 12 / iOS 15 floors; UUID remains availability-free. B2 maps `PureDate` exactly to `DATE`, `PureTime` exactly to `TIME` / `TIME_NS` (with targetless natural `TIME_NS`), and `DateTime` exactly to `TIMESTAMP_S` / `TIMESTAMP_MS` / `TIMESTAMP_US` / `TIMESTAMP_NS` (with targetless natural `TIMESTAMP_NS` only when exactly representable). B3 maps Foundation.Date exactly to TIMESTAMPTZ using signed Int64 microseconds since the Unix epoch; targetless and resolved Foundation.Date binding accept only TIMESTAMPTZ, preserve no timezone metadata, and require exact per-value equality with no tolerance/silent rounding. B4 adds shared `SwifQL.Interval`, `Value.Kind.interval == 21` with `Value.Kind` IDs `0...20` unchanged, exact finite native narrowing/transport, structural mixed-sign/non-normalized preservation, and the public `Value.interval`/Row conveniences. Ordinary SwifQL uses plain Interval/Optional transport while dynamic `Value.interval` uses dynamic routes; semantic infinity and out-of-native-range values survive generic normalization but reject at native Prepared/Appender boundaries. B5 hardens this complete non-Decimal family across result-owner lifetime, same-Connection and cross-Connection Statement concurrency, typed Appender row atomicity, transaction-local Statement concurrency, protected regressions, and a normal-import downstream consumer. Fresh R3 accepted the cumulative A2+B1–B5 vertical with zero blockers. Decimal production support remains gated behind the active Wave C implementation-plan review; nested/complex families remain separately gated. P03 exactness is accepted PASS and freezes DCT128-v1 as the production-intended Decimal algorithm.

Accepted B2 conversion and ownership anchors are: the B01 finite `PureDate` civil-domain guard precedes `duckdb_to_date`; standalone `PureTime` supports exact `24:00`; target precision is resolved and honored without rounding; negative timestamp decomposition is floor-consistent; prepared binding rejects `TIMESTAMPTZ` in B2; Appender temporal conversion and typed-value construction happen for the whole row in Phase 1 before native mutation, with deterministic failure recoverable and native Phase 2 failure terminal; and result materialization preserves source precision identity through `ResultColumn`.

Accepted B3 anchors are: `Value.Kind.timestampTZ == 20` with `Value.Kind` `0...19` unchanged; `Value.timestampTZ`, `get(Date.self)`, `timestampTZValue`, and Row Date conveniences are exact; `NativeFoundationDateCodec` owns P02 conversion and rejects DuckDB ±`Int64.max` sentinels and non-finite Foundation.Date; Prepared Date binding accepts only targetless/resolved TIMESTAMPTZ; Appender Date conversion and typed-value creation occur in whole-row Phase 1; and NativeResult reads `duckdb_timestamp.micros` and rejects non-exact/infinity values through `invalidResult`.

Accepted B4 anchors are: shared `SwifQL.Interval`; `Value.Kind.interval == 21` with IDs `0...20` unchanged; `Value.interval`, `get(Interval.self)`, `intervalValue`, and Row Interval conveniences; exact finite `Int64` → `Int32` months/days narrowing and exact `Int64` microseconds; mixed-sign/non-normalized preservation; generic normalization preservation of semantic infinity/out-of-native-range values with native Prepared/Appender rejection; direct `duckdb_bind_interval`; Appender whole-row Phase-1 planning plus direct `duckdb_append_interval` Phase 2; validity-first direct `duckdb_interval` result-vector materialization without `duckdb_get_interval` sentinel inference; legitimate all-minimum physical triple preservation; ordinary plain `Interval`/Optional transport versus dynamic `Value.interval` transport; and protected transaction `.binding` first-reason identity.

## Explicit Wave B non-goals

Wave B does not authorize:

```text
Foundation.Decimal production mutation before Wave C plan audit/coordinator acceptance
nested LIST/ARRAY/MAP/STRUCT/UNION/ENUM Value materialization
Table/full-model or arbitrary Decodable projection
migrations
DuckDB vendor mutation
SwifQL dependency changes
Bridges/PostgresBridge modernization
new platform-support claims
release/tag/publication
unrelated public API redesign
```

Work outside the active Value & Result Type Expansion capability remains in `.agent/TODO.md` and requires separate promotion/research/planning authorization.
