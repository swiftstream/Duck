# Active Tasks

Only active approved executable implementation/closure work belongs here. Detailed completed execution/audit lineage belongs in `.artifacts/**`.

## Current active capability

P0 `Codable / Model Layer` is active under the accepted corrected implementation plan.

Primary plan acceptance:

```text
.artifacts/planning/codable-model-layer-2026-09-16/PRIMARY_PLAN_ACCEPTANCE.md
```

Wave A `Decodable` model projection, Wave B `ModelEncoder`, Wave C persistence preparation, and Wave D Connection-backed `Table` insert/update are primary-coordinator accepted.

Accepted evidence:

```text
.artifacts/implementation/codable-model-layer-2026-09-16/wave-a/WAVE_A_COORDINATOR_ACCEPTANCE.md
.artifacts/implementation/codable-model-layer-2026-09-16/wave-b/WAVE_B_COORDINATOR_ACCEPTANCE.md
.artifacts/implementation/codable-model-layer-2026-09-16/wave-c/WAVE_C_COORDINATOR_ACCEPTANCE.md
.artifacts/implementation/codable-model-layer-2026-09-16/wave-d/WAVE_D_COORDINATOR_ACCEPTANCE.md
```

Wave C final architecture uses one shared `ModelScalarEncoder` authority for ordinary model encoding and individual `@Column` persistence extraction, safe omission/NULL classification, `PreparedModelValue`, `BoundModelValue`, and exact prepared bindings.

Wave D adds exactly four public `Connection`-backed `Table` persistence methods:

```text
insert(on: Connection) -> Self
insertNonReturning(on: Connection)
update(on: KeyPath<Self, C>, on: Connection) -> Self
updateNonReturning(on: KeyPath<Self, C>, on: Connection)
```

Accepted Wave D semantics include schema-qualified `Self.table` targets, omission/default versus explicit SQL NULL behavior, `BoundModelValue` prepared placeholders without payload literalization, changed non-key UPDATE SET selection, key exclusion and validation, changed-values-then-key binding order, returning zero-row `invalidResult`, and zero-changed UPDATE with no SQL-visible access. Final Correction 01 validation is 14/0/0 for combined Wave D, 10/0/0 for protected Wave C preparation, and build PASS with 0 new warnings.

The mandatory fresh Wave D root audit is CLEAN and primary-coordinator accepted:

```text
.artifacts/reviews/codable-model-layer-wave-d-root-audit-01-2026-09-17/PRIMARY_COORDINATOR_ACCEPTANCE.md
```

Current next planned executable wave is **Wave E — Transaction equivalents + rollback/ownership tests** under the already accepted P0 plan. Wave E is not started yet and must receive its own surgical frozen executor prompt plus coordinator evidence review.

Wave E implementation is limited to explicit supplied-`Transaction` equivalents of the accepted Wave D persistence conveniences and must delegate through the existing Transaction query/execute engine without weakening same-Connection restrictions, rollback-only/error behavior, or transaction ownership. Migrations, observation, pooling, Appender expansion, complex Value families, Vortegy integration, Android follow-up, Wave F, and later closure work are not executable as part of Wave E.

Because Wave E is itself a substantial public-API/ownership wave, a fresh independent Wave E root audit is mandatory after Wave E implementation/validation/coordinator review before Wave E becomes an accepted prerequisite for later P0 work.

Public Capability Closure Backfill remains complete for Query Execution, Transactions, Reusable Statements, and Appender. P0 Codable / Model Layer public closure remains pending later README/publication/Agent Skill work after implementation/final-audit gates. Central skill onboarding remains separate.

## Universal Wave B path contract

Every implemented type family must use the existing architecture and cover:

```text
ordinary query binding/execution
reusable Statement binding/reuse
Appender complete-row ingestion
result materialization
NULL / Optional
logical result metadata
boundary values and exact rejection
```

Resolved native target metadata must be honored exactly. Targetless values use only the deterministic natural target frozen by the accepted plan/corrections.

Rounding, lossy narrowing, sentinel collision, unsupported special states, and unchecked overflow are forbidden. Reject before unsafe native mutation whenever the existing architecture permits preflight.

## Frozen conversion anchors

P01 is authoritative for DATE/TIME/TIME_NS/TIMESTAMP S/MS/us/NS finite ranges, infinity sentinels, divisibility, exact 24:00 handling, checked overflow, and floor-consistent negative/pre-epoch conversion.

Important natural-target rules:

```text
targetless PureTime -> TIME_NS
targetless DateTime -> TIMESTAMP_NS only when exactly representable
```

P02 is authoritative for TIMESTAMPTZ/Foundation.Date:

```text
native identity: signed Int64 microseconds since Unix epoch
DuckDB ±Int64.max sentinels: reject for Foundation.Date
non-finite Foundation.Date: reject
conversion: Foundation-reference split algorithm
acceptance: exact bidirectional per-value equality only
silent rounding/tolerance: forbidden
```

Largest contiguous guaranteed exact subset:

```text
[-7_611_627_392_000_000, 9_568_241_792_000_000] microseconds
```

That subset is not a hard bound; sparse exact values outside it remain valid when the accepted per-value predicate succeeds.

## Current public compatibility boundary

After accepted Wave C, public `Value` supports:

```text
null
Bool
Int8 / Int16 / Int32 / Int64
UInt8 / UInt16 / UInt32 / UInt64
Float / Double
Foundation.Decimal
String
Data
UUID
Int128 / UInt128 through availability-gated bridges on macOS 15+ / iOS 18+
PureDate
PureTime
DateTime
Foundation.Date as exact TIMESTAMPTZ
SwifQL.Interval
```

`Value` is a public struct facade with internal exhaustive storage. Exact 128-bit values are stored as hidden word pairs so the package remains buildable at the macOS 12 / iOS 15 floors; UUID remains availability-free. B2 maps `PureDate` exactly to `DATE`, `PureTime` exactly to `TIME` / `TIME_NS` (with targetless natural `TIME_NS`), and `DateTime` exactly to `TIMESTAMP_S` / `TIMESTAMP_MS` / `TIMESTAMP_US` / `TIMESTAMP_NS` (with targetless natural `TIMESTAMP_NS` only when exactly representable). B3 maps Foundation.Date exactly to TIMESTAMPTZ using signed Int64 microseconds since the Unix epoch; targetless and resolved Foundation.Date binding accept only TIMESTAMPTZ, preserve no timezone metadata, and require exact per-value equality with no tolerance/silent rounding. B4 adds shared `SwifQL.Interval`, `Value.Kind.interval == 21` with `Value.Kind` IDs `0...20` unchanged, exact finite native narrowing/transport, structural mixed-sign/non-normalized preservation, and the public `Value.interval`/Row conveniences. Wave C adds `Value.Kind.decimal == 22` with all prior IDs stable, public `Value.decimal`/Row Decimal conveniences, ordinary/Optional query transport, reusable Statement binding/rebinding and transaction routing, exact Appender DECIMAL rows, and validity-first W/S-aware result reconstruction. Explicit `DECIMAL(W,S)` is authoritative; targetless Decimal uses canonical exact natural W/S including zero `1/0`; no implicit rounding or Double/Float transport is allowed; nonfinite values reject deterministically at native conversion/preflight. C2 hardens this Decimal vertical across owner lifetime, same-Statement and cross-Connection concurrency, Appender correlation, transaction routing, failure recovery, protected regressions, full-package/build validation, and a normal-import consumer. Fresh R4 accepted the complete committed Decimal vertical with zero blockers. Nested/complex families remain separately gated.

Accepted B2 conversion and ownership anchors are: the B01 finite `PureDate` civil-domain guard precedes `duckdb_to_date`; standalone `PureTime` supports exact `24:00`; target precision is resolved and honored without rounding; negative timestamp decomposition is floor-consistent; prepared binding rejects `TIMESTAMPTZ` in B2; Appender temporal conversion and typed-value construction happen for the whole row in Phase 1 before native mutation, with deterministic failure recoverable and native Phase 2 failure terminal; and result materialization preserves source precision identity through `ResultColumn`.

Accepted B3 anchors are: `Value.Kind.timestampTZ == 20` with `Value.Kind` `0...19` unchanged; `Value.timestampTZ`, `get(Date.self)`, `timestampTZValue`, and Row Date conveniences are exact; `NativeFoundationDateCodec` owns P02 conversion and rejects DuckDB ±`Int64.max` sentinels and non-finite Foundation.Date; Prepared Date binding accepts only targetless/resolved TIMESTAMPTZ; Appender Date conversion and typed-value creation occur in whole-row Phase 1; and NativeResult reads `duckdb_timestamp.micros` and rejects non-exact/infinity values through `invalidResult`.

Accepted B4 anchors are: shared `SwifQL.Interval`; `Value.Kind.interval == 21` with IDs `0...20` unchanged; `Value.interval`, `get(Interval.self)`, `intervalValue`, and Row Interval conveniences; exact finite `Int64` → `Int32` months/days narrowing and exact `Int64` microseconds; mixed-sign/non-normalized preservation; generic normalization preservation of semantic infinity/out-of-range values with native Prepared/Appender rejection; direct `duckdb_bind_interval`; Appender whole-row Phase-1 planning plus direct `duckdb_append_interval` Phase 2; validity-first direct `duckdb_interval` result-vector materialization without `duckdb_get_interval` sentinel inference; legitimate all-minimum physical triple preservation; ordinary plain `Interval`/Optional transport versus dynamic `Value.interval` transport; and protected transaction `.binding` first-reason identity.

Any future work beyond the completed Value & Result Type Expansion closure remains in `.agent/TODO.md` or other durable future-work state and requires separate promotion/research/planning authorization before becoming active executable work.
